# GraficSFML-Shapes
ALL FILES ON MASTER BRANCH.This is a completely finished third laboratory work using the SFML graphics library on the C ++ language.

Topic: Inheritance. Polymorphism.

Formulation of the problem.
Write an object-oriented program in C ++, which in a dialog mode controls the graphic objects displayed on the display screen. When you press the F1 key, the program displays a short hint on all available commands / keys.
The program must support the following general elements of the behavior of graphic objects:
1. Activation / visualization of a graphic object of the user's choice.
2. Moving with / without a trace.
3. Restore the original state of the object.
4. Color change.
5. Change of state visible / invisible.
6. Aggregation, ie the formation of new objects from existing ones. When aggregating objects, ensure the possibility of aggregation of units.
The program must allow the user to save the current configuration of the program in a user-specified text file on disk to download the current configuration of the program from the user-specified text file on disk.
